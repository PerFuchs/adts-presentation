            <h3>Bigger software == more bugs</h3>
            <p>average bug density stayed constant</p>
            <p>but average code volume increases exponentially</p>
            <p>software steers evermore important processes in our society e.g. micro trading</p>

            <aside class="notes">
                <p>
                    So far the headline is true. A study showed that the bug density over time stayed
                    constant while the size of software increased exponentially. Therefore,
                    we find evermore bugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This needs to change, not only because bugs are expensive as other papers showed but
                    especially because software controls important aspects of our society and lives e.g.
                    micro trading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People start presentation about testing with the columbia spaceshuttle dissaster
                    as an example. I believe, this example does not cover the modern situation anymore.
                    Let me explain, back then this disaster mostly hit the producers and users of the
                    software - the NASA. Nowadays, a bug causing a micro trading service to go haywire
                    might cause insolvency of a single bank but wide spread finicial crisis. Affecting,
                    not only a single company but the whole western society.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, it becomes a social responsibility to deliver good software.</p>

            <h3>Automated software testing as a service (TaaS)</h3>
            <p>fully automated testing by a service provider</p>
            <p>on infrastructure managed by them</p>
            <p>saving developing time and money</p>
            <br>
            <p>makes software reliability comparable and promotes open competition along this metric</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>My objective: making TaaS tangible</h3>
            <p>TaaS is a vision</p>
            <p>it might seems far off and probably unrealistic</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I present two papers as examples to illustrate solutions to some of TaaS challenges</p>
            <ul>
                <li>one possible implementation of TaaS by PaaS providers</li>
                <li>a promising approach to one of the main technical challenges of TaaS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These serve as examples of active research solving the challenges of TaaS</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <p>
                    My main question after reading the vision paper about Taas was: "Great story but
                    where is the substance/ the solutions
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turned out there are papers that work on most challenges mentioned in the
                    vision papers filling in these gaps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose two of those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    show one possible implementation of TaaS which is really
                    high level but shows a concrete design for TaaS
                </p>
                <p>
                    one technical paper to illustrate that to many technical challenges
                    promising approaches are existing in current research
                </p>
